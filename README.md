    Using the Tpotce projects fine work I intend to initially deploy a modified version of their sensor stack to a remote host, and the monitoring aspects (Principally the ELK stack) installed on a separate host.

    Identify high value sensor modules
    Disable third party telemetry
    Minimize footprint

    Identify sensor requirements
            Identify Hosts which provide DMZ and dedicated IP at lowest cost
            Identify which VPS size is appropriate for the sensor. And approximate bandwidth use
            Research hosting providers policies
            Identify best practices for shipping logs to minimize local node requirements
